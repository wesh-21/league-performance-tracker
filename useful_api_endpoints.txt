Obtaining Riot ID from PUUID:
For third-party apps, displaying Riot IDs in place of summoner names within frontend fields is now necessary. 
If you lack a Riot ID for a particular player in your database or wish to keep it up to date, you can acquire it through the following endpoints:
    (ACCOUNT-V1) https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#account-v1/GET_getByPuuid - 
    Use the endpoint /riot/account/v1/accounts/by-puuid/{puuid} to fetch account information (gameName + tagLine) by PUUID.


Obtaining Riot ID from summonerID:
In cases where you do not possess a PUUID for a player, you can employ the player's summonerID to obtain the PUUID:
    (SUMMONER-V4) https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#summoner-v4/GET_getBySummonerId - 
    Access the endpoint /lol/summoner/v4/summoners/{encryptedSummonerId} to retrieve summoner data by summonerID, which can be used to obtain the corresponding PUUID.
